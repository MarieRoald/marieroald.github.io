## [TurtleThread](https://turtlethread.com/)
<img src="/images/thumbnails/software/turtlethread.jpg" class="thumbnail">
TurtleThread is a tool inspired by TurtleStitch and powered by pyembroidery that lets you program an embroidery machine with a Turtle interface. It has a thorough documentation with step-by-step guides to help beginners started coding.

## [MatCoupLy](https://matcouply.readthedocs.io)
<img src="{{ base_path }}/images/thumbnails/software/matcouply.svg" class="thumbnail"> MatCoupLy is a library for fitting regularised and constrained coupled matrix factorization models (e.g. PARAFAC2 and simultaneous NMF) in Python. It uses the [AO-ADMM algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1137/21M1450033) and supports a large variety of constraints, such as the PARAFAC2 constraint, non-negativity and unimodality.

## [TensorLy-Viz](https://tensorly.org/viz)

Analysing multi-way data with tensor decomposition models requires much more than only fitting the models. For example, postprocessing is essential to resolve ambiguities in the decompositions. TensorLy-Viz simplifies this process, and provides a large variety of tools for analysing, post-processing and visualising tensor decomposition models from Python. It also has a large [gallery of examples](http://tensorly.org/viz/stable/auto_examples/index.html) which includes several guides on how to analyse multi-way data (e.g. outlier detection and selecting the number of components). TensorLy-Viz was created by me and [Yngve Mardal Moe](https://github.com/yngvem).

## [TensorLy](https://tensorly.org)
<img src="/images/thumbnails/software/tensorly.png" class="thumbnail">
TensorLy is a large collaborative effort to bring tensor decomposition methods to Python created by [Jean Kossaifi](https://github.com/JeanKossaifi). I'm a core developer of TensorLy and have contributed much of the PARAFAC2 code.
