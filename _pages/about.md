My name is Marie, and I’m a data scientist working at the [digital humanities lab](https://nb.no/dhlab) at the [National Library of Norway](https://nb.no/).

I've also got a PhD in data science focusing on tensor decomposition for time-evolving data mining, and I’m passionate about science outreach, data visualization and open science. This is my personal webpage where you can learn more about my [software projects](software), view my [publications](publications) or find my [talks](talks).
